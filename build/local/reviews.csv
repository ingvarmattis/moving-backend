Noel was super helpful on Yelp giving me the quote and on the phone when we set it up. I got updates through the process. I also loved that for no additional fee they brought wardrobe boxes for me to pack my clothes. You have to commit to the rate for at least 3 hours and they give discounts if you pay in cash.

On moving day, our movers Paul and Anthony showed up within the arrival window. Both of them were very friendly and didn't really want me lifting a finger through the process-- which I loved. They made sure to wrap up all of my furniture so it wouldn't get damaged. They brought it all to my place safely and headache-free- which is exactly what you want in your move.

Thank you to the team at Honest Moving & Storage! I would recommend and use their services again for another move.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/honest-moving-and-storage-los-angeles-2?hrid=lE-Yu1LB6Ah621XhIBpwtw&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct),2025-12-27 13:24:53.524327,2025-12-27 13:24:53.524327
3,Lance L.,5,https://storage.googleapis.com/honest-moving-static/reviews/lance_l_avatar.png,"Viktor and his crew (Ben and Slava) did an amazing job of moving all of our stuff almost 3 hours north of where we had been. They worked tirelessly non-stop, were very detail oriented and very respectful and were willing to accommodate any special requests without a problem.

Once we arrived at our new home (after an already really long day), we realized their truck wouldn't be able to fit down our long driveway to the house due to some low hanging branches and telephone lines, so we had to scramble. Viktor came up with the idea to use my pickup truck as a shuttle to go back and forth between their moving truck and our house to speed up the process. While not ideal and having to make many many trips, his idea did end up saving us a lot of time which otherwise would've lasted all night.

Pricing was transparent from the very beginning and Viktor went over the final calculations very carefully with me at the end of the evening.

I felt badly afterwards that they all had to make the long drive back home so very late at night.

All in all it was a very positive experience and I would highly recommend them.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/honest-moving-and-storage-los-angeles-2?hrid=oX_rw7QqmBRkvuVvr50rbw&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct),2025-12-27 13:27:22.866231,2025-12-27 13:27:22.866231

They were truly amazing and even helped with last minute packing of the closets that we didn't get to.

Noel took the time to confirm our reservation and Paul and Slava called ahead with an ETA when they were on the way. Paul had us confirm what we needed on arrival and we all got right to work.

Paul and Slava took special care to cover our furniture with blankets and shrink wrap. They also were extra careful with our televisions. All of the boxes we had packed were stacked and dollied onto the truck. At our new place, our movers were great at following directions for bringing up our belongings (TO THE 4th FLOOR ) and setting them in the places we wanted.
The wardrobe boxes they loan are LIFESAVERS. It was super easy to hang all of our clothes on them and quickly transfer them over into our new closet.

We had a few steps leading up into my new place and they had to remove the door to put in my fridge, so I paid a little extra. $150 was totally worth it because there is no way I or anyone I know could have helped me get it in. It's funny the things you don't think of before you move.

These guys accomplished the impossible.
